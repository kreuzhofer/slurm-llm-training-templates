# rsync, not `cp scripts/*`, for two reasons that both bit in practice:
#   * cp without -r exits 1 on any subdirectory, and `set -e` then aborts this
#     script before the activate.sh and GPU-verification steps below. A
#     __pycache__ appears the moment anyone imports sft_common from the repo,
#     so this is a normal state, not an exotic one.
#   * cp never removes anything, so a renamed or deleted script lingers in
#     $DEMO_DIR forever and the Slurm jobs keep executing the stale copy.
# Sync into $DEMO_DIR/repo, NOT $DEMO_DIR directly: the weights live in
# $DEMO_DIR/models/Qwen3.8-27B and the code in models/qwen3.8-27b/, which differ
# only by case. Keeping the repo under its own prefix keeps code and data apart
# and makes "what do the Slurm jobs actually execute" answerable with one path.
mkdir -p "$DEMO_DIR/repo"
# `tasks` holds every task (sql, judge, ...) and the Slurm jobs import from it,
# so a sync that omits it fails on the worker with ModuleNotFoundError long
# after submission. `common/` is gone -- it was the SQL task under a name that
# claimed to be task-neutral (#18).
