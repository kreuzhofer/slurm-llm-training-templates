"""
train_full.py -- full-parameter supervised fine-tuning of Qwen3.8-27B for SQL.

Run via train_full.sbatch (torchrun launches one process per GPU).

All ~26.9B text parameters are trained. The vision tower and MTP head are not
loaded at all (see model.py::load_model), so nothing needs freezing.

WHY THIS FITS, when the H100-era version of this demo had to fall back to LoRA
for a smaller model: with FSDP2 full_shard across 16 ranks the steady-state cost
is roughly

    bf16 params  54GB
  + bf16 grads   54GB
  + fp32 AdamW   216GB   (m and v)
  ---------------------
    ~324GB total  ->  ~20GB per GPU

and about 28GB per GPU if fp32 master weights are also kept. Against 268.6 GiB of
HBM on a B300 that is uncontended, which is why activation checkpointing and
batch size are tuning choices here rather than survival tactics.

CHECKPOINTING IS THE INTERESTING PART -- see the comment on SAVE_STRATEGY below.
