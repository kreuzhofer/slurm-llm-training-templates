train_lora.py -- LoRA supervised fine-tuning of Qwen3.8-27B for SQL generation.

Run via train_lora.sbatch (torchrun launches one process per GPU).

The task -- prompt construction, label masking, the 95/5 split -- lives in
tasks/sql/; the architecture-shaped parts live in model.py beside this file.
Read model.py's docstring first: it explains what is Qwen3.8-specific here.

The LoRA-specific concern is target module naming: Qwen3.8's attention is
hybrid, so the Qwen3-era target list covers only a quarter of the token-mixing
blocks. See LORA_TARGET_MODULES.

    Which modules LoRA adapts.

    LORA_TARGET_GDN=0 drops the Gated DeltaNet projections, leaving attention +
    MLP. That is the knob behind the A/B in #12: this repo targets the GDN
    projections on the reasoning that a Qwen3-era attention-only list adapts
    only 16 of 64 token-mixing blocks, while every sibling recipe for this
    architecture targets attention only -- and two of them state outright that
    LoRA should not be applied to the linear-attention projections. Neither
    position had ever been measured.

    Module counts, verified against the checkpoint (see #7):
        with GDN    400 modules, 217.58M trainable at r=32 (0.809% of 26.896B)
        without GDN 256 modules, 159.38M trainable at r=32 (0.593%)

    Note the arms are NOT capacity-matched at equal rank -- the broad list
    carries 1.37x the trainable parameters -- so a difference cannot be
    attributed to placement alone without a rank-matched third arm.

    RESULT (#12), 100 held-out examples, both arms trained identically:

        steps   arm A (with GDN)   arm B (attn+MLP)   A-only   B-only
           25         74%                75%             0        1
          500         88%                89%             0        1

    eval_loss at 500 steps: 0.01749 vs 0.01754. Across two runs at two scales
    there is not ONE example the GDN adapters get right that the narrow list
    misses, and arm B is ~15% faster per step. So GDN targeting is off by
    default: it costs 58.2M trainable parameters and 15% throughput to change
    nothing measurable. Set LORA_TARGET_GDN=1 to put it back.

    This is a measured negative result, not an assumption inherited from the
    sibling recipes -- which reached the same configuration by reasoning that
    turned out to be partly wrong (they claimed GDN layers lack MLP
    projections; all 64 layers have them, see #7).
